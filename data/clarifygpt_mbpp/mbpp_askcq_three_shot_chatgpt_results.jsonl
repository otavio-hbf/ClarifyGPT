Should the function always return a list, or is there a case where you\u2019d prefer a different container type (e.g., tuple) or an iterator?\n5.

It also counts (a,a) as a bidirectional pair.\n- Solution 1: Iterates over all unordered index pairs (i < j) and checks if test_list[i] is the reverse of test_list[j]. This counts each matching pair once, assuming elements are tuples.\n- Solution 2: Checks if (test_list[i], test_list[j]) equals (test_list[j], test_list[i]), which essentially reduces to test_list[i] == test_list[j]. It does not detect reverse relationships between distinct elements, so it\u2019s likely not correct for the intended meaning.\n- Solution 3: Attempts a check that would almost always fail for a list of 2-tuples because it tests membership of a 4-tuple in a list of 2-tuples. It\u2019s not aligning with a sensible interpretation.\n\nKey ambiguities to resolve:\n- Do you want to count ordered pairs (where (a,b) and (b,a) are considered separately) or unordered pairs (count each pair once)?\n- How should duplicates be handled? If (a,b) appears k1 times and (b,a) appears k2 times, how should the count be computed?\n- Are elements guaranteed to be 2-tuples (pairs), or can they be tuples of other lengths? How should reversal be defined for longer tuples?\n- Should self-reversing tuples like (a,a) count as a bidirectional pair?\n- Should non-tuple elements be allowed, or should the function assume the input is a list of 2-tuples only?\n\nClarifying questions (please answer or provide examples):\n1) Do you want to count:\n   - Unordered pairs (each pair counted once), or\n   - Ordered pairs (count (a,b) and (b,a) separately)?\n2) How to handle duplicates:\n   - If (a,b) occurs p times and (b,a) occurs q times, what should the total be? min(p,q), p*q, or something else?\n3) Are all elements 2-tuples (length 2)? If not, should we support any-length tuples by reversing the entire tuple?\n4) Should (a,a) count as a bidirectional pair or be ignored?\n5) Should non-tuple or malformed elements cause an error or be ignored?\n6) Can you provide a small example input and the expected output (for both unordered and ordered interpretations)?", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1297, "completion_tokens": 2553, "total_tokens": 3850, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 1984, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}]

It does not enforce an increasing subsequence (only contiguity) and ignores the subsequence constraint.\n- Solution 1: Sorts the array first and then considers products of adjacent numbers. This breaks the original order and, therefore, does not compute products of increasing subsequences in the original array.\n- Solution 2: Attempts to form a product from numbers greater than arr[i] that come after i, but it never includes arr[i] itself and still does not guarantee the chosen numbers form an increasing subsequence in the original order.\n- Solution 3: Builds a product along consecutive indices where each element is strictly larger than its immediate predecessor.

What is the exact input structure you expect?\n   - Is test_tuple always a tuple of tuples (a 2-level nesting), or can it have deeper nesting (e.g., tuples inside tuples inside tuples, etc.)?\n\n2. How should elements of different types be treated?\n   - If inner elements are not numbers (e.g., strings, None, objects), should even_fnc handle them, or should the function skip/drop them?\n   - Should booleans be treated as even/odd (since True/False are 1/0 in Python)?\n\n3. What should even_fnc\u2019s contract be?\n   - Should it be a predicate that takes a single element and returns True to keep it and False to drop it? Any requirement on its behavior for non-numeric types?\n\n4. Output structure and integrity\n   - Should the function always return a tuple of tuples with the same nesting depth as input (i.e., preserve 2-level nesting for any valid input), or is a different structure (e.g., a flat tuple or a list of tuples) acceptable?\n\n5. How to handle empty or edge cases\n   - If an inner sequence becomes empty after filtering, should the corresponding inner element in the result be an empty tuple, or should that inner sequence be omitted?\n\n6. Examples\n   - Please provide one or two concrete examples showing input and the expected output (e.g., test_tuple = ((2, 'a', 4), (3, 6, 0)) with even_fnc = lambda x: isinstance(x, int) and x % 2 == 0 \u2192 expected outcome).\n\n7.

How should edge cases be handled, such as empty tuples (e.g., both empty) or tuples containing None or incompatible elements?\n6. Could you provide a small example showing the expected input and output to confirm the intended behavior? For example:\n   - test_tup1 = (5, 7, 9), test_tup2 = (1, 6, 8) -> expected result?\n   - test_tup1 = (5, 7), test_tup2 = (1, 6, 8) -> expected result?", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1160, "completion_tokens": 2032, "total_tokens": 3192, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 1536, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}]
