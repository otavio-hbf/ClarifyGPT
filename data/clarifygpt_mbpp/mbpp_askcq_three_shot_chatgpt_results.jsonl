If returning, should the entire array (first n rearranged, plus the rest unchanged) be returned, or only the rearranged first n elements?\n- Boundary conditions: What if n <= 0 or n > len(arr)? How should these cases be handled?\n- Definition of \u201cpositive\u201d: Does it include zero or not? (This ties into how zeros should be categorized.)\n- Stability: The requirement mentions preserving relative order among negative and positive elements. Does this stability need to apply to zeros as well if zeros are treated as part of the positive group?\n\nObservations on the provided solutions:\n- Solution 0 uses sorted with key=lambda x: x < 0, which would place non-negatives before negatives (the opposite of the intended order) and relies on a slice arr[:n] but returns a new list, not necessarily mutating the original or including arr[n:].\n- Solution 1 builds two lists (negatives and non-negatives) from the first n elements and concatenates them, preserving their internal order. However, it returns only the rearranged first n elements and does not include the rest of the array (arr[n:]), so it may not meet expectations if the full array should be returned.\n\nClarifying Questions:\n1. Should the function mutate the input array in place, or return a new array?\n2. How should zeros be treated?

Output shape is (substring, start).\n\n- Solution 2: Returns a list of (start, end) for each match (indices only). Output shape is (start, end).\n\n- Solution 3: Returns a list of (substring, start, end) for each match. Output shape is (substring, start, end).\n\n- Solution 4: Uses findall and returns (substring, start_of_substring) by using text.index(match). This fails for multiple identical matches (it always uses the first index) and may mis-handle patterns with groups. Output shape is (substring, start).\n\nUnclear points in the requirement (inferred from the differences above):\n- What exact output format should be returned for each match? (substring and start, or start/end indices, or including end, etc.)\n- Should we include the matched substring itself in the output, or only indices?\n- Should overlapping matches be counted or only non-overlapping matches?\n- Should the input pattern be treated as a regex pattern (as suggested by the use of re) or as a literal substring?\n- How should cases with no matches be handled? Return None (as stated) or an empty list?\n- If the pattern contains capturing groups, how should they be represented in the output (full match vs groups)?\n- Do we want to support Unicode, case sensitivity, or other flags, or keep it simple?\n\nClarifying questions for you:\n1. What exact return format do you want for each match?\n   - Option A: (matched_text, start_index)\n   - Option B: (start_index, end_index)\n   - Option C: (matched_text, start_index, end_index)\n   - Option D: (start_index,) or some other shape\n2. Should overlapping matches be considered?\n   - Yes (count overlaps)\n   - No (non-overlapping only)\n3. Should the pattern be treated as a regex pattern or as a literal substring?\n   - Regex (as currently used with re)\n   - Literal substring (escape pattern if needed)\n4. How should we handle no matches?\n   - Return None (to match the requirement)\n   - Return an empty list\n5. If the pattern has capturing groups, should we return the entire match or the group contents?\n   - Entire match (default)\n   - Specific group(s)\n6. Should the function validate inputs (e.g., ensure text and pattern are strings) or assume valid input?\n7. Any naming or style preferences (e.g., fix the spelling \u201coccurrence\u201d vs \u201coccurance\u201d)?\n\nOptional recommendation (based on common interpretation):\n- Return a list of tuples with (matched_text, start_index, end_index) for all non-overlapping matches, using re.finditer(text, pattern). If no matches, return None.
