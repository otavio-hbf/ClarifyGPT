If the list can contain different types of elements, does the function only need to focus on the int elements and return the maximum interger in these int elements?\n    - Yes, the function should focus on the int elements and return the maximum interger in these int elements.\n    3.

What is meant by \"rotations required to generate a sorted array\"? Can you provide an example or clarify what constitutes a rotation in this context?\n    - In this context, a rotation refers to shifting the elements of the array cyclically.
