Contiguous vs non-contiguous:\n       - Contiguous: yes \u2014 \"sublist\" means a consecutive slice of l (e.g., [2,3] in [1,2,3,4] is True; [2,4] is False).\n    2. Order sensitivity:\n       - Yes \u2014 elements in s must appear in the same order inside l.\n    3. Multiplicity / duplicates:\n       - Yes \u2014 duplicates in s must be matched by at least that many consecutive occurrences in l when contiguous; e.g., l=[1,2,2,3], s=[2,2] -> True; l=[1,2,3], s=[2,2] -> False.\n    4. Return value and extra output:\n       - Return a boolean only (True if s occurs as a contiguous sublist of l, otherwise False).\n    5. Empty sublist handling:\n       - is_sublist(l, []) should return True.\n    6. Element comparison semantics:\n       - Use standard equality (==). No special/custom comparison required.\n    7. Types of elements:\n       - Assume flat lists; elements can be any types that support == (no need for recursive/nested matching).\n    8. Performance expectations:\n       - No special constraints; a straightforward O(len(l) * len(s)) approach is acceptable.\n    Example expectations:\n    - l=[1,2,3,4], s=[2,3] -> True\n    - l=[1,2,3,4], s=[2,4] -> False\n    - l=[1,2,2,3], s=[2,2] -> True\n    - l=[1,2,3,4], s=[] -> True\n    '''"}], "temperature": 1.0, "max_completion_tokens": 3000, "reasoning_effort": "low", "n": 1}

It only treats tuple objects as nested containers; lists or other iterables are not traversed by the current implementation.\n    2. Definition of \"uneven\"\n       - \"Uneven elements\" means odd integers. The function uses a predicate (even_fnc) to decide which elements to keep; with the usual predicate x % 2 == 0 it keeps even integers and removes odd ones.\n    3. even_fnc parameter\n       - even_fnc should be a provided callable predicate. It will be called on each non-tuple element; truthy return values mean the element is kept. If you want a default behavior, use lambda x: x % 2 == 0; otherwise the caller must supply a suitable predicate.\n    4. Element types\n       - The implementation expects numeric (integer) elements. If mixed types occur, those non-integer elements will be passed to even_fnc as-is \u2014 so either provide a predicate that safely handles other types or ensure the input contains ints only. A safe default approach is to skip non-integers (i.e., treat them as not satisfying the predicate).\n    5. Return type and preservation of input types\n       - The function returns a tuple and preserves the nested tuple structure (nested results are tuples). It does not preserve non-tuple inner sequence types (lists would not be traversed).\n    6. Empty and malformed inputs\n       - For an empty input tuple or empty nested tuples the function returns an empty tuple (or nested empty tuples where appropriate).

Purpose of parameter sub:\n       - In the given implementation sub is used as an internal accumulator while generating coordinates, not as an input to filter or exclude. It should be treated as an internal implementation detail (i.e., callers should ignore it). It would be better to default it to None and create a fresh list inside to avoid the mutable-default problem.\n    2. Adjacency definition:\n       - The function returns 8-way adjacency plus the original coordinate \u2014 i.e., the full 3x3 neighbourhood for an n-dimensional tuple (for 2D: all combinations of x-1..x+1 and y-1..y+1). Tests confirm diagonals are included.\n    3. Coordinate domain and types:\n       - Tests use 2-tuples of integers. The implementation works for integer coordinates and, more generally, for numeric coordinates where subtracting/adding 1 and using range makes sense (practically integers). It also generalizes to N-dimensional tuples (it computes the Cartesian product over each dimension).\n    4. Grid bounds and validity:\n       - There are no boundary checks in the implementation. Neighbours that would be negative or out of some grid are included as-is. If you need clipping/exclusion by bounds, the function must be modified to accept bounds and filter results.\n    5. Handling of duplicates and ordering:\n       - The function produces unique neighbours (no duplicates) and returns them in a deterministic order: it iterates first over the first coordinate from x-1 to x+1, and for each, over the next coordinate from y-1 to y+1, etc. This matches the ordering in the tests.\n    6. Return type:\n       - The function returns a list of coordinate lists (e.g., [[x-1,y-1], [x-1,y], ...]). If you prefer tuples or a set, it should be adjusted.\n    7. Error handling:\n       - The current code does not validate inputs (e.g., tuple length, element types). For robustness you should validate that ele is a tuple of integers (or numeric types) and raise an error or handle invalid inputs as desired.\n    8. Mutable default argument:\n       - The implementation uses sub=[ ] as a default, which is unsafe because the same list would be reused across calls. Prefer sub=None and create a new list inside the function if an accumulator pattern is needed.\n    '''"}], "temperature": 1.0, "max_completion_tokens": 3000, "reasoning_effort": "low", "n": 1}

What should be the type of the output? `ChainMap` object or a regular dictionary?\n    - The merged dictionaries should be a regular dictionary.\n    2. Should the merged dictionary contain all key-value pairs from all three input dictionaries, and what should happen if there are overlapping keys?\n    - Yes, the merged dictionary should contain all key-value pairs from all three input dictionaries, and when there are overlapping keys, the value from the first dictionary in the input sequence should take precedence.\n    3. Can you provide an input-output example to help us better understand your requirement?\n    - Yes, here is an input-output example: assert merge_dictionaries_three({\"R\": \"Red\", \"B\": \"Black\", \"P\": \"Pink\"}, {\"L\": \"lavender\", \"B\": \"Blue\"}, {\"G\": \"Green\", \"W\": \"White\"}) == {'B': 'Black', 'P': 'Pink', 'R': 'Red', 'G': 'Green', 'L': 'lavender', 'W': 'White'}\n    '''"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "def merge_dictionaries_three(dict1,dict2, dict3):\n    merged_dict = ct.ChainMap(dict1, dict2, dict3)\n    return dict(merged_dict)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "User Requirement:\ndef check_smaller(test_tup1, test_tup2):\n    '''\n    Write a function to check if each element of second tuple is smaller than its corresponding element in the first tuple.\n    Clarification:\n    1. The function checks that each element of the second tuple is strictly less than the corresponding element in the first tuple (i.e., it tests test_tup2[i] < test_tup1[i], implemented as test_tup1[i] > test_tup2[i]).\n    2. The current implementation uses zip, so it compares only up to the length of the shorter tuple (extra elements in a longer tuple are ignored).\n    3. \"Smaller\" is interpreted as strictly less-than (<) (not <=).\n    4. The function assumes corresponding elements are comparable (e.g., numbers). If uncomparable types are present, a TypeError will be raised; the function does not special-case mixed/uncomparable types.\n    5. For empty tuples: all() over an empty iterator returns True, so (empty, empty) yields True. If one tuple is empty and the other is not, zip is empty and the function also returns True (vacuously true).\n    6. The function does not perform input-type validation; it assumes valid tuple-like inputs and comparable elements and will raise errors if those assumptions are violated.\n    '''"}], "temperature": 1.0, "max_completion_tokens": 3000, "reasoning_effort": "low", "n": 1}
